Fruit Classifier (Beginner Level Project)

This is a beginner-level deep learning project for fruit classification.
The model is trained to classify **5 types of fruits**:
- Apple
- Banana
- Grapes
- Mango
- Orange

The project follows a simple ML pipeline:
**Training → Save model → Reuse model → Deploy with Streamlit**

Tools and libraries required
- Python
- PyTorch
- Torchvision
- Streamlit
- Jupyter Notebook


Run following commands in your terminal
            ⬇️
Create virtual environment :


Syntax: python -m venv venv


Then activate : 

Syntax(window) : .\venv\Scripts\Activate 

Syntax(Mac) : source venv/bin/activate


Install libraries : 

Syntax : pip install -r requirenment.txt



And after this you are able to run first.ipynb

⚠️ be carefull this .ipynb file works on google collab if you use
your own system please check carefully of your dataset path

after sucessfuly run you get a "model.pth" file that is your reusable model

i use this model in my main.py file and deploy with the help of streamlit
